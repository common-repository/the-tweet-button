A super simple way to add the latest Twitter Tweet Button to a WordPress post or page.

== Description ==
After installing and activating the plugin, simply add a tweet_button shortcode to the content editor for a post or page.

Example Shortcode: 
[tweet_button tweet="The Tweet Button is super simple to set up and increases my social media exposure" size="large" via="wplauncher" hashtags="thetweetbutton,tweetinghasneverbeenthiseasy"][/tweet_button]

And, a Tweet button will appear in its place.

Check out a working example of the The Tweet Button on a post at [Blog.WPLauncher.com](https://blog.wplauncher.com/add-twitter-tweet-button-wordpress). Click on the blue Tweet Button and see what your site visitors would see when they click on that button.
